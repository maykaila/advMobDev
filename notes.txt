To be improved (if u wanna continue this project):
1. Functions would be in a different file
2. Styles in a separate file
3. Add an update/edit function
   3.1. make the buttons functional (eg. the useless blue square)
4. Design should be slayable bc design/aesthetic >>>>>>>>>>> functionality
That is all for now. Peace out!
